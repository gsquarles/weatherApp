# weatherApp

This is a weather App I created using async await.  This is the first project
I made using asynchronous functions.  It was pretty simple and straightforward
using async/await and an api to get the information I want and then display it.
I would of liked to make it look more professional, but I'm not very good at thinking of how to make a good designed
page.  Maybe later I will come back to it and make it look better as well as add new features
such as future forecast and maybe instead of a button to change from Farenheit to Celsius a slider type toggle.
